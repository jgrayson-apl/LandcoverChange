        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          The Clark Labs’ conterminous US land cover prediction for 2050 was produced as part of the development of the
          Land Change Explorer – a web application to illustrate the potential of predictive land change modeling and to
          introduce potential users to the Land Change Modeler – a cloud-based software service for land change modeling
          to be offered in the ArcGIS Marketplace.

          Procedure
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          <div>
            The prediction is based on an empirical modeling of the relationship between land cover change from 2001 to 2011
            and a series of explanatory variables. The land cover data were at a 30 meter resolution from the National Land
            Cover Database (NLCD). The explanatory variables<sup>1</sup> were:
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Elevation</li>
            <li>Slope</li>
            <li>Proximity to primary roads</li>
            <li>Proximity to secondary roads</li>
            <li>Proximity to local roads</li>
            <li>Proximity to high intensity development</li>
            <li>Proximity to open water</li>
            <li>Proximity to cropland (used only for transitions to cropland)</li>
            <li>Protected areas</li>
            <li>County subdivisions or counties/incorporated places (depending on the state)<sup>2</sup></li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            The modeling procedure used is a newly developed algorithm suitable for distributed computing in a cloud
            computing environment<sup>3</sup>. Briefly, the procedure is based of kernel density estimation of the normalized likelihood
            of change associated with varying levels of each independent variable. These estimates are then aggregated by
            means of a locally-weighted average where the weights are based on the degree of conviction each variable has
            about the outcome at that specific pixel. Testing has shown it to be comparable in skill to a multi-layer
            perceptron neural network with the added advantages of rapid calculation and capability of being distributed
            across multiple computer nodes.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          Because the drivers of change can vary over space, modeling was done separately for each state. All transitions
          that met or exceed 2 km2 in area (at the state level) were modeled independently. Within a single state, as many
          as 128 individual transitions might occur. In total, over the 48 conterminous states, 3330 transitions were modeled.
          The modeling process initially establishes the potential to transition. This potential is expressed as a
          continuous value from 0 to 1 at each pixel for each transition. The procedure then uses the Markovian assumption
          that the rate of transition experienced in the historical period (2001-2011 in this case) will continue into the
          future. A competitive greedy selection process then allocates the projected change<sup>4</sup>.
        </div>


        <div class="about-dialog-section-label">
          Validation
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          In the training process for each transition, 50% of historical instances of change and 50% of an equal-sized
          sample of pixels eligible to change, but which did not (e.g., persistence), were reserved for model validation.
          The median accuracy over all 3330 transitions was 80% with 79% of change validation pixels being correctly
          predicted and 83% of persistence pixels being correctly predicted. Thus the models, on average, are quite
          balanced in their ability to predict change and persistence.
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          The accuracy associated with more specific transitions varied. A key objective was to be able to monitor and
          project anthropogenic changes and thus the explanatory variables chosen were focused on such drivers.
          Consequently, the median accuracy of natural to developed transitions (such as deciduous forest to low intensity
          development) was 92%. Again, accuracy was evenly balanced (93% for change / 91% for persistence).
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          Accuracy for transitions between developed categories was lower at 77% (80% change and 75% persistence). A
          large part of this is because of the inconsistent manner in which roads are classified in the NLCD system. Roads
          are classified as one of the developed categories (high, medium, low and open development) based on the amount
          of impervious surface detected within pixels. Alignment of image pixels can cause this to vary resulting in roads
          that frequently switch classes between the years mapped.
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          Natural transitions, such as forest to shrub, had the lowest overall accuracy at 74%. This was expected because
          many drivers cannot be predicted with the variables used. An example would be forest fires caused by lightning.
          This is also reflected in the fact that accuracy for predicting change was only 71% while that for predicting
          persistence was 78%.
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          Finally, in states with significant cropland development, natural to cropland transitions were modeled with a
          79% overall median accuracy. Accuracies for change and persistence were 78% and 81% respectively.
        </div>

        <div class="about-dialog-section-label">
          Disclaimer
        </div>
        <div class="about-dialog-section">
          Note that there are many highly plausible future outcomes and the specific scenario presented is only one of
          these (albeit judged to be the most plausible). Also note that each state is modeled separately (on the assumption
          that drivers of change many differ between states). As a consequence, there may be some mismatches at the
          boundaries between states. Generally, these are only evident for states that have large quantities of natural to
          natural transitions (e.g., with forest plantation crop cycles or frequent fire) where the accuracy is lower.
          Also note that the protected areas layer does not include all protected areas. Some local conservation land may
          be missing. Finally, note that the modeling is based on the assumption that rate of change experienced within
          the historical period (2001-2011) will persist into the future.

            Elevation data were from the National Elevation Database while slope was derived from those data. All
            roads data were acquired from the Census Bureau TIGER line files for 2014. Earlier road data would have
            been preferred, but errors in earlier TIGER line files were deemed to be unacceptable. Country
            subdivisions, counties and incorporated places were also acquired from the Census Bureau. Protected areas
            came from the Protected Areas Database of the USGS National Gap Analysis Program. All proximity layers

            In some states, planning jurisdiction is controlled by county subdivisions (such as in New England), while

            the western states).

            Greedy selection assumes that the specific pixels that will change are those that are ranked the highest.
            Conflicts are resolved by assigning them to the transition with the highest marginal transition potential.
